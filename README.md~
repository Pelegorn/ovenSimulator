## General Overview
This script was created within the scope of an EUT project (EUT-P3-19HS-08). The project group investigated the behaviour of mangos in different ovens. With the help of this script the ideal behaviour of a convection oven can be simulated. For the creation of the graphics X-Steam is used. Furthermore, the script can also simulate a condensation dryer, which is operated with a heat pump. The program CoolProp was used to calculate the heat pump statically.

## Function description
### mangoSimulator
This function starts the software with a splashScreen wrapper.

### specificIdealConvective
Returns output data for ideal convective drying processes.
#### inputs:
* app: GUI-data variable
#### outputs:
* energySecondary: Secondary energy used to dry mangos
* energyPrimary:   Primary energy used to dry mangos
* energyButane:    Amount of Butane needed
* CO2weight:       emitted CO2 due to burning butane

### specificIdealCondensation
Returns output data for ideal condensation drying processes.
#### inputs:
* app: GUI-data variable
#### outputs:
* energySecondary:    Secondary energy used to dry mangos
* energyPrimary:      Primary energy used to dry mangos
* energyElectricity:  Current needed in kWh
* CO2weight:          emitted CO2 due to burning butane

## idealDrying
Calculates an ideal convective dryer (e.g. ideal ATESTA).
### inputs:
* m_hum_in:   humidity of raw-mango (in percent)
* m_hum_out:  humidity of dry-mango (in percent)
* s_air_hum:  humidity of air at the coldest point (in percent)
* t_in:       air temperature entering the oven (burner temperature) in degree Celsius
* t_in:       air temperature leaving the oven (chimney temperature) in degree Celsius
* UIaxes:     GUI-Axes File to plot psychrometric chart
### outputs:
* energy_per_kg_mango:    amount of energy used by ideal convective dryer
* air_per_kg_mango:       amount of air used, to transport the needed energy (can be used to calculate a fan)
